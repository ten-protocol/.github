# TEN Protocol

Welcome to the TEN protocol Github!

TEN is an encrypted layer 2 rollup on Ethereum, being built by Obscuro Labs, the team that previously built [R3 Corda](https://www.r3.com).

TEN provides Web3 developers with the same features they'd find in Web2, massively opening up the design space for what you can build in Web3. 

You can learn more about what we are building on our [website](http://ten.xyz) and in our [developer documentation](https://docs.ten.xyz)
